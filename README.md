Security part:
In the application properties we create three entries contaning the job_id, for the roles in the application (CEO, accounting, sales).
In the set up dataloader we used these three entries to initialize each role privileges, and encrypt all the employee's passwords.
We make sure that the password is not null or empty in the database and the default password is (email + "12345") for every account.

The calculation of the decile part:
To calculate the decile, we follow this approach: The decile is any of the nine values that divide the sorted data into ten equal parts, so that each part represents 1/10 of the sample or population. A decile is one possible form of a quantile.
